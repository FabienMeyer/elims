# Code of Conduct

## Community Pledge

This community welcomes, protects, and supports all participants.

The community fosters an environment that respects and promotes the dignity, rights, and contributions of all individuals, regardless of characteristics including race, ethnicity, caste, color, age, physical characteristics, neurodiversity, disability, sex or gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, language, philosophy or religion, national or social origin, socio-economic position, level of education, or other status. Everyone who participates in good faith receives the same privileges of participation according to this Covenant.

## Encouraged Behaviors

While acknowledging differences in social norms, all participants strive to meet the community's expectations for positive behavior. Everyone understands that words and actions may get interpreted differently than intended based on culture, background, or native language.

With these considerations in mind, all participants agree to behave mindfully toward each other and act in ways that center shared values, including:

1. Respecting the **purpose of the community**, activities, and ways of gathering.
1. Engaging **kindly and honestly** with others.
1. Respecting **different viewpoints** and experiences.
1. **Taking responsibility** for actions and contributions.
1. Giving and accepting **constructive feedback** thoughtfully.
1. Committing to **repairing harm** when it occurs.
1. Behaving in other ways that promote and sustain **community well-being**.

## Restricted Behaviors

The community restricts the following behaviors. Instances, threats, and promotion of these behaviors violate this Code of Conduct.

1. **Harassment.** Violating explicitly expressed boundaries or engaging in unnecessary personal attention after any clear request to stop.
1. **Character attacks.** Making insulting, demeaning, or pejorative comments directed at a community member or group of people.
1. **Stereotyping or discrimination.** Characterizing anyone’s personality or behavior on the basis of immutable identities or traits.
1. **Sexualization.** Behaving in a way that would be considered inappropriately intimate in the context or purpose of the community.
1. **Violating confidentiality**. Sharing or acting on someone's personal or private information without their permission.
1. **Endangerment.** Causing, encouraging, or threatening violence or other harm toward any person or group.
1. Behaving in other ways that **threaten community well-being**.

### Other Restrictions

1. **Misleading identity.** Impersonating someone else for any reason, or pretending to be someone else to evade enforcement actions.
1. **Failing to credit sources.** Not crediting the sources of content you contribute.
1. **Promotional materials**. Sharing marketing or other commercial content in a way that's outside the norms of the community.
1. **Irresponsible communication.** Failing to responsibly present content which includes, links or describes any other restricted behaviors.

## Reporting an Issue

Tensions can occur between community members even when they're trying their best to collaborate. Not every conflict represents a code of conduct violation, and this Code of Conduct reinforces encouraged behaviors and norms that can help avoid conflicts and minimize harm.

When an incident occurs, it's important to report it promptly. To report a possible violation, you can contact [GitHub](https://github.com/FabienMeyer).

Community Moderators take reports of violations seriously and respond promptly. They investigate all reports of code of conduct violations, reviewing messages, logs, and recordings, or interviewing witnesses and other participants. Community Moderators keep investigation and enforcement actions as transparent as possible while prioritizing safety and confidentiality. To honor these values, enforcement actions occur in private with the involved parties, but communicating to the whole community may be part of a mutually agreed upon resolution.

## Addressing and Repairing Harm

If an investigation by the Community Moderators finds that someone violated this Code of Conduct, the following enforcement ladder may help determine how best to repair harm, based on the incident's impact on the individuals involved and the community as a whole. Depending on the severity of a violation, lower rungs on the ladder may get skipped.

1. Warning
   1. Event: A violation involving a single incident or series of incidents.
   1. Consequence: A private, written warning from the Community Moderators.
   1. Repair: Examples of repair include a private written apology, acknowledgement of responsibility, and seeking clarification on expectations.
1. Temporarily Limited Activities
   1. Event: A repeated incidence of a violation that resulted in a warning, or the first incidence of a more serious violation.
   1. Consequence: A private, written warning with a time-limited cooldown period designed to underscore the seriousness of the situation and give the community members involved time to process the incident. The cooldown period may get limited to particular communication channels or interactions with particular community members.
   1. Repair: Examples of repair may include making an apology, using the cooldown period to reflect on actions and impact, and being thoughtful about re-entering community spaces after the period is over.
1. Temporary Suspension
   1. Event: A pattern of repeated violation which the Community Moderators have tried to address with warnings, or a single serious violation.
   1. Consequence: A private written warning with conditions for return from suspension. In general, temporary suspensions give the person being suspended time to reflect upon their behavior and possible corrective actions.
   1. Repair: Examples of repair include respecting the spirit of the suspension, meeting the specified conditions for return, and being thoughtful about how to reintegrate with the community when the suspension is lifted.
1. Permanent Ban
   1. Event: A pattern of repeated code of conduct violations that other steps on the ladder have failed to resolve, or a violation so serious that the Community Moderators determine there is no way to keep the community safe with this person as a member.
   1. Consequence: Access to all community spaces, tools, and communication channels gets removed. In general, permanent bans should get used rarely, should have strong reasoning behind them, and should only occur if working through other remedies has failed to change the behavior.
   1. Repair: No possible repair exists in cases of this severity.

This enforcement ladder serves as a guideline. It doesn't limit the ability of Community Managers to use their discretion and judgment, in keeping with the best interests of the community.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual officially represents the community in public or other spaces. Examples of representing the community include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
